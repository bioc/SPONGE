\usage{
sponge_subsampling(subsample.n = 100, subsample.repeats = 10,
  subsample.with.replacement = FALSE, subsample.plot = FALSE,
  gene_expr, mir_expr, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{subsample.n}{the number of samples to be drawn in each round}

\item{subsample.repeats}{how often should the subsampling be done?}

\item{subsample.with.replacement}{logical, should we allow samples to be used
repeatedly}

\item{subsample.plot}{logical, should the results be plotted as box plots}

\item{gene_expr}{A gene expression matrix with samples in rows and featurs
in columns. Alternatively an object of class ExpressionSet.}

\item{mir_expr}{A miRNA expression matrix with samples in rows and features
in columns. Alternatively an object of class ExpressionSet.}

\item{...}{parameters passed on to the sponge function}
}
\value{
a summary of the results with mean and standard deviations of the
correlation and sensitive correlation.
